🦁🦓 AR Virtual Zoo Tour & VR Cube Shooter
Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR) Projects

This repository contains two immersive interactive projects developed using Unity 3D, showcasing the power of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in education, training, and entertainment.

## 🐾 Augmented Reality Project – AR Virtual Zoo Tour
📌 Project Description

The AR Virtual Zoo Tour is an educational AR application that displays lifelike 3D animal models (tiger, elephant, horse, etc.) when users scan specific image markers or flashcards using a smartphone. The animals appear in real-world space and can be viewed from any angle.

The project aims to transform traditional learning into an interactive, immersive experience, making wildlife exploration accessible from anywhere.

## 🎯 Objectives

Create an immersive virtual zoo using AR.

Present 3D animals that users can explore through mobile devices.

Provide an engaging educational tool for wildlife learning.

Use Unity + Vuforia / AR Foundation for AR tracking and rendering.

Offer a virtual field-trip experience for students.

Blend digital 3D content smoothly with real-world visuals.

## 🛠️ Development Tools

Unity 3D – main development platform

Vuforia Engine / AR Foundation – image tracking, plane detection

Blender / Sketchfab – 3D animal models

Android Studio – APK building/testing

Hardware: AR-supported Android device / webcam

## 📂 Working Flow

Project Setup – Unity project creation with Vuforia enabled

Vuforia Configuration – license key, ARCamera setup

Importing 3D Models – high-quality animals from Sketchfab

Image Targets – scanned markers trigger specific animals

AR Implementation – connecting models to targets

Testing & Optimization – scaling, alignment, mobile performance

Deployment – APK build and real-device testing

## ✅ Conclusion (AR Project)

The AR Virtual Zoo Tour demonstrates how AR enhances learning through 3D visualization, interactive exploration, and realistic animations, making education more engaging and accessible. It opens opportunities for digital museums, virtual field trips, and smart learning applications.

## 🎮 VR Project – VR Cube Shooter
📌 Project Description

VR Cube Shooter is an action-based Virtual Reality game where players use VR controllers as guns to shoot cubes floating on a 3D plane. Successful hits destroy cubes with particle effects, sound, haptics, and increase the player’s score.

This project highlights VR fundamentals such as real-time tracking, physics, collision detection, scoring systems, and performance optimization.

## 🎯 Objectives

Implement core VR shooting mechanics using VR controllers

Ensure reliable raycast/projectile hit detection

Use object pooling for smooth performance

Add immediate feedback: audio, VFX, haptics

Maintain a real-time score UI/HUD

Use modular, documented C# scripts

Test using platforms like Meta Quest, SteamVR, etc.

## 🛠️ Development Tools

Unity 3D (LTS) – main engine

OpenXR + XR Interaction Toolkit – VR input & tracking

Oculus Integration / SteamVR SDK (optional)

Visual Studio – scripting

Blender – 3D models (guns, cubes)

Audacity – audio effects

Unity Profiler – performance optimization

Meta Quest / PCVR headset – device testing

## 📂 Working Flow

Project Initialization – XR setup in Unity

Player Rig Setup – XR Origin, controller mapping

Gun Mechanics – raycast/projectile shooting

Cube Targets – physics, VFX, destruction logic

Hit Detection – collider-based/raycast-based

Scoring System – HUD display + animation

Game States – menu, play, pause, game over

Build & Deployment – APK or PCVR build

## ✅ Conclusion (VR Project)

The VR Cube Shooter provides a responsive, immersive VR experience showcasing the potential of VR for gaming, training, and spatial-interaction applications. It serves as a foundation for advanced VR systems involving multiplayer modes, AI-based targets, leaderboards, and more.
